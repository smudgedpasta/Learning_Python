# Learning_Python
An absolute not important mess of me studying Python from the ground up. Some code is referenced from the ProgrammingWithHarry YouTuber.

Be warned, you may find yourself cringing and dying inside at a lot of these messy experiments. I'm just posting this because I want to know how this site works and some people have wanted to know what I'm doing I guess.

You have been warned, sorry not sorry. :')
