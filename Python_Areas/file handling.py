'''
The following examples do not include opening from a folder
If you want to open from a folder, for example, "FileHandling_Txts", it would be: open("FileHandling_Txts/TestFile.txt")

a = open("TestFile.txt", "r") < This means you want to read the file
a = open("TestFile.txt", "a") < This means you want to append (add more content) to the file
a = open("TestFile.txt", "w") < This means you want to write onto the file, but all former content of the file is erased
a = open("TestFile.txt", "x") < This creates the file (and errors if the file exists already)

By adding a t, for example, a = open("TestFile.txt", "at"), this means you want to handle the file as a text
By adding a b, for example, a = open("TestFile.txt", "ab"), this means you want to handle the file as a binary
